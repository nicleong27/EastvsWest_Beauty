# East vs West Skincare

# Goal:

With all the craze behind Eastern (Korean and Japanese) skincare, you wonder if there is a "success" formula to it all. The overarching goal for this project was to identify ingredients in skincare products that help quantify whether or not Eastern ones are better than Western ones. 

# Data Processing:

Utilizaing the Sephora dataset found on Github. The data contains the product's name, description, brand, ingredients (if available), category, average rating, price, reviewer's skin type.
